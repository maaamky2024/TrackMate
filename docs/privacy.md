# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: May 8, 2025_

TrackMate (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the TrackMate – Red Flag Journal app.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Local Data**  
  All data, including--but not limited to--journal entries, logged interactions, emotion tags, and pattern-analysis data are only stored **locally** on your device. We do **not** ever collect or transmit any of this data to any servers. Ever.

- **Device Permissions**  
  If you enable biometric lock (Face ID/Touch ID), the app uses your device’s secure enclave to authenticate but does not access or store any of your biometric data.

- **Crash Reports & Analytics**  
  We do not collect crash reports, analytics, or usage telemetry unless you explicitly opt in by beta-testing via TestFlight, or via Settings → Privacy → Send Diagnostics.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- **App Functionality**  
  Local storage of your entries enables journaling, pattern analysis, and red-flag tracking.

- **Security Features**  
  Biometric and passcode locks protect your locally stored data from unauthorized access.

- **Optional Diagnostics**  
  If enabled, sending us diagnostic data helps us identify and fix bugs in future updates.

---

## 3. Data Sharing & Disclosure

- We do **not** ever share, sell, or rent your personal data to third parties.
- We will never store, collect, or disclose journal or interaction data without your explicit consent.
- If legally required (e.g., a court order), we may be compelled to disclose minimal user account metadata (such as account creation date, last active date, etc.). We do not store any personally identifying account data beyond your email if you choose to provide it in Settings → Account.

---

## 4. Your Choices

- **Data Reset**  
  You can permanently delete all local data at any time by uninstalling the app--because all data is stored locally on your device, uninstalling the app will delete any and all data on your device that is associated with the app.

- **Diagnostics**  
  Toggle crash-reporting or analytics opt-in at Settings → Privacy → Send Diagnostics.

---

## 5. Security

We use industry-standard encryption for any optional data in transit and rely on Apple’s secure enclave for biometric authentication. Your local database is encrypted at rest.
