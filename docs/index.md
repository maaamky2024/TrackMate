## ❓ FAQ

**Q: How do I reset my entire journal?**  
A: Go to your Journal tab, swipe left on the journal entry that you want to delete, then tap delete. This will permenantly delete the journal entry you do this to and cannot be recovered once deleted. 

(The ability to delete all data or all of a specific category of data (i.e., only journal entries and keep logged interactions) will be available in future updates).

**Q: Why am I not getting notifications?**  
A: If you are not getting notifications, please check your phone's notification settings by going to your **settings app** -> **Notifications** -> **TrackMate**. 

If **Allow Notifications** is toggled off, please toggle them on to recieve daily notifications about toxic behaviors.

If **Allow Notifications** is toggled on and you are not receiving notifications, please report the issue here ->  https://github.com/your-username/trackmate-app/issues

**Q: Can I export or back up my data?**  
A: Not yet—export/backup is coming soon in a future update. For now, your data is only stored locally (meaning on your device) and is secured by your biometrics (Face-ID).
